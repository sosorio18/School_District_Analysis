# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to modify the data for Thomas High School. There was some dishonesty specifically in reading and math grades for ninth grade. Therefore, data had to be replaced only for Thomas High School 9th graders while still leaving the rest of the data the same. 
## Results
* The district summary was not affected by the changes. The image below shows the summary of the average math and reading scores, percentage of passing math and reading, and the overal passing percentage of charters and districts. The summary of the original data was the same.

## Summary
* The four changes that show after replacing the reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School are the following: average math score, average reading score percentage of passing reading, and percentage overall passing of Thomas High School. However, the changes do not affect the whole data so much, meaning the removal of that data does not have a great impact on the district analysis.
