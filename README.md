# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to modify the data for Thomas High School. There was some dishonesty specifically in reading and math grades for ninth grade. Therefore, data had to be replaced only for Thomas High School 9th graders while still leaving the rest of the data the same. 
## Results
